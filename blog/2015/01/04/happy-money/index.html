<div class="entry-content"><p>This is an outline of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Happy-Money-Science-Happier-Spending/dp/1451665075/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420409031&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=happy+money">Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending</a>, by Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton</p>

<p><strong>Five principles of happier spending</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Buy experiences, not things</p>

<ul>
<li>Things tend to produce the most happiness when they are brand new, and then happiness quickly declines as time goes by. In contrast, experiences tend to produce more happiness as time goes on, as we remember those experiences and share them with others.</li>
<li>Housing and cars are the two most expensive things most of us purchase, yet they produce little happiness.</li>
<li>Even very short experiences can provide a lot of happiness if there is enough time to anticipate the experience beforehand.  For example, a 2-day vacation can provide as much happiness in anticipation as a 2-week trip.</li>
<li>4 qualities of good experiences

<ol>
<li>Brings you together with other people, fostering a social connection.</li>
<li>Makes a memorable story you can enjoy retelling (e.g. Tough Mudder)</li>
<li>Tightly linked to your sense of who you are or who you want to be.</li>
<li>The experience is a unique opportunity, so it can&rsquo;t be easily compared with other options. Unfavorable comparisons can reduce satisfaction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Make it a treat</p>

<ul>
<li>Even a short break from something you can enjoy can make the experience more pleasurable. Examples:

<ol>
<li> Commercials actually make TV more enjoyable, even for those who say they dislike commercials.</li>
<li> Sharing a yacht with 7 people is actually more enjoyable than owning a yacht, precisely because the yacht is not always available to use.</li>
<li> People enjoy a song much more (and are more willing to pay for concert tickets afterwards) if the song is interrupted for a few seconds in the middle by a discordant sound.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A series of small pleasures is better than a few large ones. For example, two 30-minute massages will bring more pleasure than a single 1-hour massage, because of the forced break between massages.</li>
<li>Whatever your vice is, from chocolate to alcohol, you will get more pleasure out of it if you consume it occasionally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Buy time</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>U-index</strong>: the proportion of time a person spends in a predominantly negative emotional state. You can often directly lower your U-index by spending money.

<ol>
<li> <em>Exercise, prayer, reading, and sex</em> are activities usually accompanied by a positive mood, so spending more time on these activities can improve one&rsquo;s U-index.</li>
<li> <em>Working, commuting, shopping and housework</em> are usually accompanied by a negative mood, so reducing these activities can improve one&rsquo;s U-index.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In general, you should make decisions based on time, not money. People who do this tend to use their time on activities that promote wellbeing, like exercising.</li>
<li><strong>A rule of thumb</strong> when making a major purchase: think about how the purchase will affect the way you spend your time this coming Tuesday. e.g., building a pool in your backyard may sound like a good idea, but you won&rsquo;t even be able to use the pool on Tuesday because of your long commute home from work.</li>
<li>Three important activities related to time and money

<ol>
<li> Commuting &ndash; do less commuting, even if it is costly. In general, an extra 22 minute commute time is equivalent a 1/3 reduction in salary, in terms of happiness.</li>
<li> Television &ndash; cheap, but little emotional payoff. Spend money to do something more active (buy an experience!), like a cooking class.</li>
<li> Socializing &ndash; extremely important for happiness, so you should socialize more, even if you are able to work less (and hence earn less money).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Time is money&rdquo; may be true, but thinking of time that way can reduce happiness. Don&rsquo;t think of time as a vehicle to get more money. Think of happy time as an end in itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Pay now, consume later</p>

<ul>
<li>People get the most enjoyment out of a positive experience before it happens, during the anticipation.</li>
<li>Positive anticipation is very important for happiness. The ability to generate pleasant thoughts about the future is the main difference between happy and suicidal people.</li>
<li>Uncertainty intensifies anticipation, both positive and negative. That&rsquo;s why receiving an unknown gift is more fun than receiving an expected gift.</li>
<li>Three signs that delaying gratification will produce more happiness:

<ol>
<li> The delay provides an opportunity to seek out enticing details about the experience that will promote excitement.</li>
<li> When anticipation makes you drool (literally or otherwise).</li>
<li> When the consumption itself will be fleeting, so anticipation provides a chance to draw out the pleasure.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Pre-paid purchases feel free, removing the pain of spending that can reduce happiness at the time of consumption. It can also reduce the pain of sunk costs: not using a concert ticket you paid for 3 months ago is much less painful than not using one you paid for yesterday.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Invest in others</p>

<ul>
<li>Spending on others can often make you significantly happier than spending on yourself.</li>
<li>A good benchmark is that at least 1/10th of your spending should be on other people, including charity, gifts for friends/family, etc.</li>
<li>Three strategies to boost the happiness benefits of spending on others:

<ol>
<li> Make it a choice &ndash; if you feel pressured into giving then you lose most of the emotional payoff.</li>
<li> Make a connection &ndash; try to connect with the person you are helping. It&rsquo;s much better to treat someone to a free coffee in person rather than buying them a gift card. Some charities, like donorschoose.org, try to create a connection between the giver and receiver.</li>
<li> Make an impact &ndash; if you feel like your money is making an impact, then you will be happier. Giving to a large, nebulous organization like UNICEF does not improve happiness as much as giving to an organization like Kickstart, which promises to spend your $250 on an item that will help a single family escape from poverty.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
