<p>In my <a href="/blog/2013/11/12/stumbling-on-happiness/">last post</a>, I mentioned that most economists and psychologists agree that after people make it out of poverty and into the middle class, more money does not buy more happiness. However, my friend <a href="https://github.com/jianli">Jian Li</a> pointed out that this isn&rsquo;t entirely true, citing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/business/16leonhardt.html">an article in the NYTimes</a> about the recent work of two economists, Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t access the paper linked in the NYTimes article (the page is timing out), but I was able to find an <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/06/stevenson_and_w.html">EconTalk podcast with Stevenson and Wolfers</a> where the findings are discussed in detail. In it, they argue that contrary to the famed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easterlin_paradox">Easterlin paradox</a>, which they relabel as the &ldquo;Easterlin hypothesis&rdquo;, absolute income <em>is strongly positively correlated</em> with happiness. And the data seems to back them up.</p>

<p>For the moment, though, I stand by my previous claim that after escaping from poverty, additional income does not have a large effect on happiness, and it seems that Stevenson and Wolfers would agree. In the podcast they make two points that support this view:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>While maintaining that there is a strong positive correlation between absolute income and happiness (.8, to be exact), they stress that happiness is proportional to the log of income, meaning that each time a person&rsquo;s income is doubled it will only add a fixed constant to their level of happiness. For example, doubling someone&rsquo;s income from $50,000 a year to $100,000 a year will produce the same increase in happiness as further doubling their income from $100,000 to $200,000.</p>

<p>So money does buy happiness, but after a certain point the effect of an extra dollar, or even an extra thousand dollars, becomes negligible. I&rsquo;m not sure where these thresholds are located, perhaps it varies significantly from person to person, but for me, personally, I feel that there isn&rsquo;t much extra happiness to be gained from additional income beyond the middle-class level.</p></li>
<li><p>While Stevenson and Wolfers are certain there&rsquo;s a positive correlation between income and happiness, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that more money will make us as happy as we think it will, or that there aren&rsquo;t other elements of life that have a much bigger impact on happiness. This agrees with what Daniel Gilbert said in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427">Stumbling on Happiness</a> (see <a href="/blog/2013/11/12/stumbling-on-happiness/">last post</a>), namely, that people tend to overestimate how much happiness they&rsquo;ll get from additional income.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>In conclusion, I would be surprised if there&rsquo;s a silver bullet on the road to achieving greater happiness, but I do hope that there is some low-hanging fruit along the way. However, at least for those of us that don&rsquo;t live in poverty, additional income is not it.</p>
