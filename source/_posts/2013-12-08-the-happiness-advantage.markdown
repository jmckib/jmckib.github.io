I recently finished reading [The Happiness Advantage](http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Advantage-Principles-Psychology-Performance-ebook/dp/B003F3PMYI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1386570447&sr=8-1&keywords=the+happiness+advantage)
by Shawn Achor. The book begins by convincing us that happiness leads to
success, rather than the more conventional belief that success leads to
happiness. Then, the author spends the rest of the book summarizing seven
principles for increasing our happiness.

First, I'd like to summarize some of my thoughts on the book, and then in the
next blog post I'll provide a condensed list of the techniques from the book
that I think are most useful.

### Is happiness just a means to an end?

Achor tells us that we should not strive towards success in order to make
ourselves happy. This I agree with, for a few reasons:

- As I learned from [Daniel Gilbert](/blog/2013/11/12/stumbling-on-happiness), we are not good at
predicting our future happiness. In fact, we systematically overestimate how happy we will be after a positive future event. To put it in terms of my own experience, I do feel some small temporary happiness when I achieve success, but then the bar moves higher and I continue to strive for another goal,
just as unhappy was I was before.
- If we peg our happiness on an imagined future, then we often forget to enjoy the present.
- The imagined future that we hope for may simply never come. Wouldn't it be better to be happy regardless of our circumstances?

So I agree that it is better to focus on happiness rather than on some external measure of success. However, Achor goes on to tell us that we've got it backwards; we should be making ourselves happy *in order to* succeed. My objection is straightforward; isn't happiness an end in itself? Why is it that we only consider the pursuit of happiness worthwhile if it leads to success?

It turns out that there is some disagreement on this issue. For example, in "Economic Growth and Subjective Well-Being: Reassessing the Easterlin Paradox. Comments and Discussion", a response to a paper written by [Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers](/blog/2013/11/24/the-easterlin-hypothesis), Gary Becker and Luis Rayo suggest that humans seek to maximize something they call *utility*, of which happiness is only one component. This, they explain, is why people might rationally choose to take a higher paying job that will make them less happy because of a longer commute time.

My view is that happiness is the thing which we seek to maximize above all else, and when we fail to do so it is because we made a mistake, a mistake that we would reverse if possible. For the most part, we know how happy we are at any given time, though we do not always remember how happy we were in the past.

To me, it makes sense to maximize self-reported happiness at the cost of everything else. The way I come to this conclusion is simple: imagine that you are given the opportunity to experience two different lives, and in one life your self-reported happiness is consistently higher than the other. Do you need any other information to know which life you would choose? For me, personally, the answer is no. Self-reported happiness, by its definition, is the thing we want.

### Weak evidence

So I disagree with Achor that happiness is a means to an end, but more to the
point, does he do a good job of showing us how to achieve happiness? I say yes,
but with some caveats. My major objection is that Achor
cherry-picks evidence in order to make his points. For example, in the chapter
"The Fulcrum and The Lever", he points to a famous experiment done by Robert
Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson where they demonstrate that a teacher's
expectations of his student have a strong effect on the student's
performance. However, when you look into the literature, you'll see that later
researchers have had difficulty reproducing the experiment's results.

There is another instance in which an experiment cited by the author was so
unbelievable that I had to look it up myself. In "The Fulcrum and
The Lever" chapter, the author mentions an experiment where Japanese
students did not have an allergic reaction when they were rubbed
with poison ivy, but only if they were told that the plant they were being
rubbed with was harmless. In addition, the students *did* have an allergic
reaction when they were rubbed with a harmless plant and told that it was
poison ivy. When I looked up the source, [an article in the Science section of the NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/13/science/placebos-prove-so-powerful-even-experts-are-surprised-new-studies-explore-brain.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm),
it turned out that the Japanese study was not cited. In fact, I could not find it
anywhere. I am not sure that the study was ever done, and I cannot find an instance of it being replicated.

So, Achor is less than careful with some of the research that he cites, but is that a
reason to avoid this book? No, I don't think so. Many of the techniques he
mentions are cheap to try. For example, he suggests that once a day, you should write down three positive things that happened to you that day. This technique is
cheap to do (literally, it is free), the activity itself is pleasant and hardly
takes more than a few minutes, so why not give it a try? For techniques that
are unpleasant or inconvenient, it makes sense to check if the research is well
replicated, but in many cases I don't think this is necessary. More on this in
the next post.
